# Notice:
- Q2 has problem in one direction, cannot show f(x) is in K[x]
- Q3 is simple, will make this up sometime
- Don't know how to do Q21 and Q24
- Q18 can only show that group is abelian, but the remaining step is the same
- Using result from Q39 to Q40 b) conflicts with the result from hint of Q40 b)
