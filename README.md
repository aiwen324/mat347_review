# Notice:
- Q2 has problem in one direction, cannot show f(x) is in K[x]
- Q3 is simple, will make this up sometime
- Q6 has problem, cannot show i in L, instead, use conjugate subgroup H such that |H|=2, then [L:L^H]=2
- Don't know how to do Q21 and Q24
- Q18 can only show that group is abelian, but the remaining step is the same
- Q41 b) first solution has problem, should be phi(p^n-1)
